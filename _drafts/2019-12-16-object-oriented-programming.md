In this post, I'll be giving a quick primer on Object Oriented Programming or OOP.

This explanation will be a more general one - each programming language has its own nuances and syntax for the various things explained in here. 

# Base Definitions and Knowledge 
Objects -> essentially the same definition as a regular object, an entity that can be acted upon

Classes -> these are the blueprints for objects -- these are referred to when creating a new object

Instances -> these are the actual manifestations of objects in your code. For example, you could have people that own a Honda Accord. The Honda Accord car line is the object, while the individual cars that people own are the instances. They can also be referred to as instance objects.

Attributes -> 

Behavior

# Pillars of Object Oriented Programming
There are four pillars to OOP. Incorporate these into your programming, and you'll be sure to become a gR8 programmer.
- inheritance
- abstraction
- encapsulation
- polymorphism

## Inheritance
The most prominent of all is inheritance.

Inheritance is well.... inheritance.

Aptly named, inheritance refers to ability of
